Well getting Docker running on the Raspberry Pi wasn't too hard, when you run a basic docker container and run apt-get install on it to check packages.
Then hand write the Dockerfile file.

The Nginx container is up on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/jfuhrmie/nginxbase-arm/)

The next step is to get rebuild --- https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy --- for armhf


I will place the Docker Blog build, and nextcloud onto github shortly and on hub.docker soon after
