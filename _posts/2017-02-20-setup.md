Setting up 3 Raspberry Pi 3's as a docker swarm, and an additional Raspberry Pi 1 as a file server has been an intresting development.

I have been looking into Orchestration software to assist in the instilation and manegemnt of these machines, and their docker containers.

I have been looking into SaltStack and Ansible, but have not yet decided which I will continue using.

I managed to find a Tutorial on [SC5](https://sc5.io/posts/a-private-raspberry-pi-cloud-with-arm-docker/) from back in 2014, based on Arch Linux but running on the Raspberry Pi.

Yes it is 3 years old, but even though technology changes, and software updates, the same general concepts stay the same.

Here is the bash script that I used to assist me in installing docker onto my Pi's

---


First download [Debian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)  

### NOTE: change sda to the dev name of your micro sd card. ELSE it will delete your whole computer.

```
#write the downloaded and extracted raspbian image to the micro sd card
sudo dd if=2017-01-11-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/sda1

#make a tempory directory
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/USB

#mounts the micro sd card to the tempory directory
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/USB/
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/USB/boot
cd /mnt/USB/

#mounts the micro sd card for setting up on the local computer, then chroots into it.
sudo mount --bind /dev dev
sudo mount --bind /sys sys
sudo mount --bind /proc proc
sudo chroot /mnt/USB

#run the standard updates, then install sshfs (an awesome utility)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y sshfs

#gets Docker
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

#standard enable docker and set timezone
sudo systemctl enable docker.service 
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Melbourne

#changes something...
sudo sed -e 's@/usr/bin/docker -d@/usr/bin/docker -d -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375@' -i /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

#dynamically sets the hostname of the computer to the mac address of the eth port
sudo cat > /usr/local/bin/sethostname.sh << EOF
#!/bin/sh
name=$(tr -d ':' < /sys/class/net/eth0/address)
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname $name
echo "127.0.0.1"  $name >> /etc/hosts
EOF

#makes script execuitable
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sethostname.sh

#runs the script at startup
sudo cat > /etc/systemd/system/sethostname.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Set hostname to MAC address
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sethostname.sh
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl enable sethostname.service

#re-generate ssh host keys
rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

#enables ssh access to the pi
sudo touch /boot/ssh

#syncs writes all disks
sync

exit

#un-mounts sdcard from computer
sudo umount dev
sudo umount sys
sudo umount proc
sudo umount -R /mnt/USB

```

---

Once you have then completed that, you can test this on a Pi, or follow the next command, get a backup of the system, then place that onto the others.


```
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=rpiDockerBK.img

#now swap the sd card

sudo dd if=rpiDockerBK.img of=/dev/sda

```

You should now be able to run docker containers on your Raspberry Pi.

### NOTE:

You may still require to setup docker swarm if you want them working as a cluster.
