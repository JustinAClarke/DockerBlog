Well apparently I have been running down the wrong lines with docker.

Planning on 
 * Running Nginx as a backend proxy
 * Running Nginx in all containers for serving the websites.
 
In the past week I have found the following programs that will asist in running Docker on the Raspberry Pi:
 * [Traefik](https://traefik.io) for the backend proxy, including dns creation and SSL either via Lets Encrypt or domain provider
 * [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) for running the actual sites.
 
This will assist in reducing the size of the Containers, even though I am not too worried about sizing.

A new (jfuhrmie/nextcloud-arm)[https://hub.docker.com/r/jfuhrmie/nextcloud-arm/] Container is currently getting built, and I will test then push to Docker Hub.

These new Programs have been written in Go, and have compile options for arm, and x86_64.

These new Programs, even thought I have no experiance with Go, have been useful and easly extendable and will assist in the additional creation of future docker containers.
